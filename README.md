# Employee Tracker

## Description

This project is a command-line app with the sole purpose of managing, viewing, and editing a company database. It simplifies the navigation process for the user to access information on employees in the company. Creating the project, I learned all about the intricacies of MySQL, Node.js, and Inquirer.
